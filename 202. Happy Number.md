Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
Example: 
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


Note:
提交的方法虽然通过了，但是假定了如果循环次数超过10次则无限次重复此过程
看到别人提交的方法中通过hashset的方式记录已经出现过的数字，如果重复出现，则会陷入无限循环。

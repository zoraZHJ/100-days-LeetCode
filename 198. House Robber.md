You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.


Notes:
非相邻，可能间隔>=1

#stupid 仅仅考虑了间隔=1的情况
        len_num = len(nums)
        if(len_num==0):
            return 0
        elif(len_num==1):
            return nums[0]
        idx = 0
        sum_even = 0
        sum_odd = 0
        while(idx < len_num):
            if idx%2 == 0:
                sum_even += nums[idx]
            else:
                sum_odd += nums[idx]
            idx += 1
        return sum_even if sum_even > sum_odd else sum_odd


#初步思路： 动态规划
以第i个元素结尾的最大值来自：与其间隔超过1的元素为结尾的最大值 + 当前第i个元素的值
最后返回的最大值一定来自以最后两个元素为结尾的dp数组值

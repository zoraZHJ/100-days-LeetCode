Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Notes:
一道动态规划题
dp列表表示以i为结尾的最长无重复字符串
初始状态dp[0] = 1
 if s(i+1) in sub_s中，其中sub_s为以s[i]结尾的最长字符串:
dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1
else if s(i+1) not in sub_s中,
dp[i+1] = 1， 错误的，忘记考虑s[i+1]字符与之前的字符连起来构成的字符串。
应该为dp[i+1] = dp[i-1] - s[i+1]在sub_s中出现的index值。可以直接减的原因是以s[i-1]为结尾的字符串唯一包含字符s[i+1]

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
Example:
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5


 返回中序遍历的结果
 空节点处返回null
 注意list的右半部分nums[root_pos+1:]，不能写为nums[root_pos+1:-1]，最后一个值不会被include
